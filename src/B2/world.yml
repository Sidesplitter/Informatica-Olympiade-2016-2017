  # Each coordinate has a gap between itself and the next one
  # So when you have [1, 2], it gets interpreted as [1, 0, 2]
  # This is because of the way the map is specified in the documentation.
  # All of the vertical rows have an offset of +1 since they are never on the same row as the vertical coordinates

  #First row
  # Horizontal
  [27, 26, 27, 23, 18, 10, 17, 12, 22],
  # Vertical
